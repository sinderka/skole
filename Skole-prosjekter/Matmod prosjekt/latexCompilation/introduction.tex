\section{Introduction}
%We chose project 1. Our focus was making numerical solvers for the problem in all dimensions, and putting som boundary conditions on the edges to estimate the time for the signalt to transmitt. We also modeled the time using what we have learned for matematical modeling. \\
In this report, we start by showing a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of Brownian motion as a first model for the diffusion of neurotransmitters.  Next, modeling equations are derived for the initial model, as well as the expanded model which includes glia cells.  After this, mathematical modeling is used to obtain a rough estimate of the time used to transmit a signal. This is followed by several attempts at solving a 1D model of the problem, and then a 2D model.
