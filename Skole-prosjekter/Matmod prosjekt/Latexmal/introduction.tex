\section{Introduction}
%We chose project 1. Our focus was making numerical solvers for the problem in all dimensions, and putting som boundary conditions on the edges to estimate the time for the signalt to transmitt. We also modeled the time using what we have learned for matematical modeling. \\
We tried to find the time estiamte for the signal to be transmitted in several different ways. 
A good way to start was by finding a time scale.
