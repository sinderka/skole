We now assume that all $\nabla_x c_i(x)$ are linearly dependant, and want to show that if this is the case, then all $\nabla c_i(x)$ must be paralell.
%For vectors to be paralell they must have the same incline number, that is 
%$ \nabla_x c_i(x) = \nabla c_l(x), \forall i \in{1,\cdots,n} $. 

If we have two dependant vectors, they can be written as
$$ \lambda_1 c_1+\lambda_2 c_2 = 0  \rightarrow c_1 = -\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}c_2 $$
So indeed they are paralell.
By assumption all $\nabla c_i(x)$ are linearly dependant thus all $ \nabla c_i(x)$ are paralell.
